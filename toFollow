🎉 **Perfect! It's working!** 

I can see from your console output that:

✅ **`📁 Creating new profile data file...`** - The persistent storage file was created
✅ **`💾 Profile saved successfully`** - Your profile changes are being saved to disk  
✅ **`💾 Profile data stored in: ...\userProfile.json`** - Data is stored in a file that persists

## You can now test it:

1. **Go to your profile page** and make changes (edit name, bio, etc.)
2. **Click "Save Changes"** - you'll see the success message
3. **Refresh the page** - changes should still be there!
4. **Stop and restart your server** (`Ctrl+C` then `npm run dev`) - changes will persist!

## Check the data file:

You can open `userProfile.json` in your project folder to see the saved data:

```bash
# View the file content
cat userProfile.json
# or on Windows
type userProfile.json
```

## What's happening:

- **Before**: Changes were only in memory → lost on refresh
- **Now**: Changes saved to `userProfile.json` file → persist forever! 🎯

The persistence is working perfectly! Your profile edits are now permanently saved.
